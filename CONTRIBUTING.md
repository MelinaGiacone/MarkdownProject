## Code Style

To ensure the project's code is consistent and maintainable, please follow these coding guidelines:

### 1. **Indentation**
   - Use **2 spaces** for indentation (do not use tabs).
   
### 2. **Variable and Function Naming**
   - Use **camelCase** for variable and function names.
   - Use **PascalCase** for class and component names.

### 3. **Quotations**
   - Use **double quotes** (`"`) for strings, unless single quotes (`'`) are preferable in certain cases.

### 4. **Comments**
   - Comment your code when necessary to explain logic or sections that may be hard to understand.
   - Avoid obvious or redundant comments.
